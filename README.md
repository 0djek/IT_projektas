# IT Projektas
Theme was 35, about recipes
I wasn't able to complete the task succesfully, sadly. I didn't make the bonus tasks (upload images). Honestly, I was short on time, that's why I skipped it.


# Requirements
- Python 3.10
- A lot of packages, better do `pip install -r req.txt`

# Got Mark

Mark was 6. Also, I got the task to filter recipes by recipe creator nickname.
