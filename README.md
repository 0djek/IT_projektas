# IT Projektas
Theme was 35, about recipes
I wasn't able to complete the task succesfully, sadly. I didn't make the bonus tasks (upload images). Honestly, I was short on time, that's why I skipped it.


# Requirements and configuration
## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- A lot of packages, better do `pip install -r req.txt`
- Prepared database
    - MySql or MariaDB (either should work)
    - Database created: `it_maistas`
    - Created tables and their structure

## Configuration
### Database
- File: `config.py`
- You can change everything, that has name db_*
- Those values are used to connect to database

# Got Mark
Mark was 6. Also, I got the task to filter recipes by recipe creator nickname (included here).

# Testing
No tests were made, but might make later (need to learn them, ya know)

# Contribute
Wow, really? Well, if you insist, make a pull request, I might add it.
